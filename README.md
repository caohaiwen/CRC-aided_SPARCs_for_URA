This repository contains source codes for simulation results shown in one submitted paper "CRC-aided SPARCs for URA". Specifically, this repository includes two folders which correspond to ``CRC-BMST codes for stitching'' and ``CRC-aided SPARCs for URA''.

For the folder about ``CRC-BMST codes for stitching'', it contains:
1. one subfolder includes MATLAB source codes for implementation of our proposed CRC-BMST codes.
2. the other subfolder includes MATLAB sourced codes for implementing the origianl tree codes (written by Dr. Alex Fengler).

For the folder about ``CRC-aided SPARCs for URA'', it contains MATLAB source codes for simulating the whole unsourced random access channel model via our proposed concatenated coding scheme. 

If there is any confusion regaridng the MATLAB source codes, please feel free to let me know by either using issues or [emailing](haiwen.cao94@gmail.com) me.
