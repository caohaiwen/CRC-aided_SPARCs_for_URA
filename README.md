This repository contains source code for the simulation results presented in one paper titled "CRC-aided SPARCs for Unsourced Random Access." The repository includes three folders: "CRC-BMST codes for stitching," "CRC-aided SPARCs for URA," and "parameter configurations."

For the folder about "CRC-BMST codes for stitching," it contains:
1. one subfolder includes MATLAB source codes for implementation of our proposed CRC-BMST codes;
2. the other subfolder includes MATLAB source codes for implementing the origianl tree codes (written by Dr. [Alex Fengler](https://alexfengler.github.io/)).

For the folder about "CRC-aided SPARCs for URA," it contains MATLAB source codes for simulating the whole unsourced random access channel model via our proposed concatenated coding scheme. 

For the folder about "parameter configurations," it contains '.mat' files which store the specific parameters used in the submitted paper's simulation results.

If there is any confusion regaridng the MATLAB source codes, please feel free to let me know by either using issues or [emailing](mailto:haiwen.cao94@gmail.com) me.

If this project has been helpful to your research, please cite it accordingly.
